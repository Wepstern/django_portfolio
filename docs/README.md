# Portfolio Website with Django
This project is a simple one-page website written in Django where you can share your resume, projects and expertise. The project relies on Bootstrap on the frontend side and the Pytest framework on the testing side.

Currently the page can be loaded with data via the Django builtin admin site, but in the future I would like to enable this directly via a dedicated admin site where the uploaded data and the result of the page formatting can be seen immediately.

## Development Environment
The following steps below are used to create the development environment. Currently the project is only macOS "friendly", because the helper scripsts are written in shell, and the pre-commit and pre-push scripts are relay on it. I do not plan to implement the project on the "Windows way", because I want to containerise the project in the future.

After completing the following steps git pre-commit and pre-push will run automatically tests and create coverage report.

Due to the size of the project, flawless test execution and 100% coverage is mandatory for admin.py, models.py and views.py to perform commit and push operations. Currently the project has no UI test, but I will change that in the future.

Installing the development environment creates the Django server superuser, and its data like name, email and password are derived from three environment variables that you must set in your bash profile.

```bash
% open ~/.zprofile
```
Add the three new line below to zprofile, then save it and restart your terminal.
```bash
export DP_SUPERUSER_NAME=[name_of_superuser]
export DP_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=[email_of_superuser]
export DP_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=[password_of_superuser]
```

Setting up a development environment manually
```bash
django_portfolio % mkdir venv
django_portfolio % python -m venv venv/django_portfolio
django_portfolio % source venv/django_portfolio/bin/activate
django_portfolio % pip install -r requirements.txt
django_portfolio % python djportfolio/manage.py migrate
django_portfolio % python djportfolio/manage.py makemigrations
django_portfolio % git config core.hooksPath ../.githooks
django_portfolio % python djportfolio/manage.py createsuperuser
```

Setting up a development environment using helper scripts
```bash
scripts % ./install_dev_env.sh
```

### Running tests
Tests can be run in three ways: manually, with helper scripts, with commit and push processes. The latter is mandatory. The results of test runs and code coverage are logged. If you use the helper scripts, the coverage report will open automatically in your browser.

The results of code coverage results can be found in two locations: 
- django_portfolio/djportfolio/htmlcov/index.html
- django_portfolio/djportfolio/coverage.xml 

The former is generated during test execution by manual or helper scripts, while the latter is generated by pre-commit and pre-push scripts. The results of running the pre-commit and pre-push test are processed by the scripts/coverage_checker.py script, and only return zero when 100% coverage is achieved, allowing the commit and push process to complete.

Running tests directly from terminal
```bash
django_portfolio % cd djportfolio
django_portfolio % cd pytest
```

Running tests using helper scripts
```bash
scripts % ./runtest.sh
```

### Running the server
The server can also be started using the helper scripts and directly from terminal.

Running the server directly from terminal
```bash
django_portfolio % source venv/django_portfolio/bin/activate
django_portfolio % python djportfolio/manage.py runserver
```

Running the server using helper scripts from terminal
```bash
scripts % ./runserver.sh
```
